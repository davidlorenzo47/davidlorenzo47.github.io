                I am a solutions-driven Computer Science graduate student with excellent problem-solving skills seeking internship opportunities where I can enhance my implementation skills that can contribute to the companyâ€™s growth. I love coding and some of my favorite programming languages include C++, Java, Python, and Javascript.

                I am currently pursuing my Master's Degree in Computer Science and Engineering from Santa Clara University and will be graduating in the year 2024. I completed my Undergraduate studies in Computer Engineering at the University of Mumbai in 2022 with a CGPA of 8.64 on a scale of 10.00.

                I am an ex-Data Science Intern and during my internship, I got to learn a lot in the field of Machine Learning and Data Visualization. I got a chance to work on various real-life projects one of which was utilizing data visualization tools including Seaborn to deliver insights on the sales of a retail firm which helped me gain a lot of knowledge and experience.

                My hobbies include listening to music and playing outdoor sports. I also love adventure sports.

                I like to talk with people and exchange opinions about various technologies shaping our lives with gradual improvements. Feel free to talk with me and share your opinion about any technologies.
